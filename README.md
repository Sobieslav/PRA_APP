# PRA

PRA is a simple application I wrote in Django as the final project of the Python Developer course organized by Coders Lab.

It is not a perfect Django app in every respect. It is meant to test my progress and the knowledge we gained from the course.

Due to the fact that this is a back end course, the visible website look is not ideal. It is only meant to represent a sample look (this was not the purpose of the course)

The purpose of the application is to replicate a simple rating site for games and movies, something along the lines of IMDb but with a much simpler look and functionality.

This application should enable:

    View lists of games and videos registered on the internal database.
    Ability to review simple information about games and movies
    Ability to view reviews that registered users have written (writing reviews as an anonymous user is not possible)
    Ability to edit game and movie data and add new ones to the database
    Ability to search for a game or movie (title) by several words (results are grouped by category)


I fully understand that at this point I can not call myself a professional programmer, but the creation of this application gave me a lot of fun.

I hope the code insights will allow you to assess whether my skills are up to the task of taking on a professional role in a software development team.

Thank you and have a great day!
